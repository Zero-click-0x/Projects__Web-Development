## 🚀 What it does

- Renders 8 colored boxes with flexbox (`order`, `gap`, `align-content`, etc.)
- Single-click = remove only the text inside a box
- Double-click = remove the whole box
- Type “box3” or “div3” in the input to bring removed items back
- Keeps two running lists (“Removed Text” & “Removed Box”) so you can see state change in real time

## 🛠️ Built with

- HTML5 – semantic markup
- CSS3 – flexbox layout, custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript – event delegation, DOM creation / removal, form handling

## 🧪 Learning highlights

- `closest()` for event delegation
- `order` CSS property manipulated via JS
- Arrays as minimal state store (`removedText[]`, `removedBox[]`)
- `preventDefault()` on form to stay in single-page mode
